# Sockets Project

->Created TCP socket server and client for the Computer Networks class.

->The server is written in Python, while the client is multi-language(Python and PHP).

->Clients create 3 arrays (sorted, random, reverse sorted), which will be given to the server when the connection is established.

->When the server gets those, it uses 3 sorting algorithms(Bubble, Merge, Recursive Selection) to count the steps made by each algorithm.

->Afterwards, it returns to the client the number of steps of all sorting methods for each array, thus observing exactly how many steps each algorithm makes in Best Case, Average Case, Worst Case.
